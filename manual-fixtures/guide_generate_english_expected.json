  "narration_script": "Welcome to the magnificent Eiffel Tower! Standing proudly at three hundred and thirty meters tall, this iron beauty has been watching over Paris since 1889. Can you believe it was built in just over two years? Gustave Eiffel and his team used over eighteen thousand individual iron parts and two and a half million rivets to create what would become the most iconic symbol of France. And here's the really fascinating part — many Parisians absolutely hated it when it was first built! A group of famous artists even signed a petition calling it a disgrace to the city. Well, I think those seven million annual visitors would strongly disagree!",
