Provide your response as a JSON object matching this schema:

```json
{
  "schema": "guide_content.v1",
  "landmark_name": "string — the landmark name",
  "locale": "string — the language code used",
  "title": "string — an engaging title for the guide",
  "summary": "string — 2-3 sentence overview of the landmark",
  "facts": [
    {
      "heading": "string — fact category or topic",
      "body": "string — the interesting fact or historical detail"
    }
  ],
  "narration_script": "string — full narration text optimized for spoken TTS delivery, focused entirely on the landmark",
  "fun_fact": "string or null — an especially surprising or delightful tidbit",
  "confidence_note": "string or null — included only if you are uncertain about any facts"
}
```

Rules:
- Include 3-6 facts, each focused on a different aspect (history, architecture, cultural significance, interesting stories, etc.)
- The narration_script should be written for natural spoken delivery — no bullet points, no markdown, just flowing speech
- NARRATION TONE: Write as if mid-tour — the listener is already standing in front of the landmark. Dive straight into the content. Do NOT open with greetings, introductions, or meta-commentary (no "Hi friends", "Welcome", "Today we'll be looking at", "Let me tell you about", etc.). Start directly with an interesting fact, vivid description, or the landmark's story.
- CRITICAL: The narration_script MUST follow the Regional Dialect/Accent instructions exactly. Use the specific regional vocabulary, phrasing, and conversational style described. This directly controls how the text-to-speech engine pronounces the narration. For example, if the dialect hint says "Tehran Persian", write as a local Tehrani would speak — not in Afghan Dari or formal literary style.
- All written content (title, summary, facts, fun_fact) should also follow the regional dialect but can be slightly more formal than the narration
- The fun_fact should be genuinely surprising or delightful — something that makes people say "wow, I didn't know that!"
- If you are uncertain about any historical fact, include a confidence_note
- All content must be in the requested locale/language
